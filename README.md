# WindWakerOnline-CommandBuffer
C Replacement for Psi's ppc for more maintainability. Lots of info robbed from the [hacking docs](https://github.com/LagoLunatic/WW-Hacking-Docs) and [api](https://github.com/LagoLunatic/WW_Hacking_API).
The purpose of this is to allow the [Wind Waker Online](https://github.com/hylian-modding/WindWakerOnline) mod to issue commands to the game natively. Has support for returning data as well.

## Building
Install powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc-10 and binutils and run build.sh. Might make a makefile later.
